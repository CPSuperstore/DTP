# Data Trebuchet Protocol
Data Trebuchet Protocol for flinging large volumes of data from a client device to a server device over UDP

**Disclaimer**: I am quite new to C, so please keep in mind there are some ineffeniencies in the code. 
Feel free to optimize and improve. I think this is a really cool protocol, and with the right TLC we can make it great!

This repo is still a work in progress, however, the Python implementation is available in the [DTPython Repository](https://github.com/CPSuperstore/DTPython)
